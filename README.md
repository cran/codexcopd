## codexcopd

R package for the CODEX (comorbidity, obstruction, dyspnea, and previous severe exacerbations) index: Short and Medium-term (3 to 12 months) Prognosis in Patients Hospitalized for COPD Exacerbations described in [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215345888](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215345888).

### Installation

You can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("resplab/codexcopd")
```

### CODEX Index

To get CODEX index, you will need to pass in patient's risk factors. For example: 

```
codex (age = 40,charlson = 8 , FEV1 = 40, mMRC = 3, exacerbation = 2)
```

The ***codex()*** function returns a CODEX index with possible values range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of death. It was a successful predictor of survival and readmission at 3 months and 1 year after hospital discharge for a COPD exacerbation. 

### Cloud-based API Access
The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access CODEXindex through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for CODEXindex please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).
